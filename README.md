# Prolog Logic Programming
## Set Operations
* Only uses built-in *member* predicate
* Sets are represented as lists where element order does not alter to the result of the operation
* Assumed that lists given as inputs do not include repeated elements
* Input sets are assumed as fully instantiated
## Permutation Squares
* A permutation square is a 3-by-3 square of single digit numbers where each digit is used exactly once, and the sum of the numbers in the rows, columns, and diagonals are all the same
* Generates number permutations
